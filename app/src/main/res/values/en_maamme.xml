Oh my country, Finland, my country of birth,
rings, word golden!
No valley, no hill,
no water to love the beach,
as the homeland of this north,
land dear fathers!

Is poor in our country, so we stay,
if gold mines
Its a guest, yes, an abandoner,
but for us the most expensive country is this,
its islands, islands, continents,
those of us are golden.

Let us love you
we touch it with froth,
the hum of the eternal glory,
our stars, summers bright,
with all the pictures and songs
mi sank into my heart.

Here Auro, swords, thoughtful
our fathers fought,
as the day lay in the clouds
or shone with luck,
here are the most difficult of the Finnish people
they were afflicted.

The struggles of this people who can
they tell you who?
When the war in our valleys rings,
and the frost famine brought,
who measured that charmer
and the suffering of it?

This is where its blood flowed
for our good,
has enjoyed this joy
and sighed his sorrows
the people to whom I was ancient
our load on the pledge.

The feeling of being here is unmatched
and all the best,
though luck what comes
the land of the fatherland we have it.
Mi in the world is kinder
and what's more expensive?

And here, here is this country,
that is what our eyes see.
we can reach out
and the water shows the beach
and say, is that what it is,
the land Our dear father.

If we were to shine
albeit in gold clouds,
that would not cry,
but the most joyful soul would receive,
to this poor home
however we want.

The home of truth, poetry
land of a thousand lakes
miss' protection of our lives,
a land of memories, a land of hope,
just being happy happiness,
free and happy.

Sun in its bloom from its shell
for once,
still our loves are getting up
your wish, joy in its splendor,
and once, my country of birth sang
a higher echo can be obtained.
