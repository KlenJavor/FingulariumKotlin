Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,
Pondered deeply and reflected
How he best should woo the maiden,
Hasten to the long-haired maiden,
In the gloomy land of Pohja,
Sariola, for ever misty,
She the far-famed Maid of Pohja,
She the peerless Bride of Pohja.
There the pale-grey boat was lying,
And the boat with red he painted,

And adorned the prow with gilding,
And with silver overlaid it;
Then upon the morning after,
Very early in the morning,
Pushed his boat into the water,
In the waves the hundred-boarded,
Pushed it from the barkless rollers,
From the rounded logs of pine-tree.
Then he raised a mast upon it,
On the masts the sails he hoisted,

Raised a red sail on the vessel,
And another blue in colour,
Then the boat himself he boarded,
And he walked upon the planking,
And upon the sea he steered it,
Oˊer the blue and plashing billows.
Then he spoke the words which follow,
And in words like these expressed him:
˝Enter, Jumala, my vessel,
Enter here, O thorn most gracious,

Strengthen thou the hero´s weakness,
And the weakling do thou cherish,
On these far-extending waters,
On the wide expanse of billows.
˝Breathe, O wind, upon the vessel,
Drive, O wave, the boat before thee,
That I need not row with fingers,
Nor may thus disturb the waters,
On the wide expanse of ocean,
Out upon the open ocean.˝

Annikki, the ever-famous,
Night´s fair daughter, maid of twilight,
Long before the day had risen,
Early in the morn had wakened,
And had washed her clothes and spread them,
And had rinsed and wrung the clothing,
Where the red steps reach the furthest,
Where the planking is the broadest,
Out upon the misty headland,
On the shady island´s ending.

Then she turned and gazed around her,
In the cloudless air surrounding,
And she gazed aloft to heaven,
And from shore across the water,
And above the sun was shining,
And below the waves were gleaming.
O´er the waves her eyes were glancing,
To the south her head was turning,
To the mouth of Suomi´s river,
Where the stream of Väinölä opens.

On the sea a blotch she sighted,
Something blue among the billows.
Then she spoke the words which follow,
And in terms like these expressed her:
˝Whatˊs this speck upon the ocean,
What this blue upon the billows?
If it be a flock of wild geese,
Or of other beauteous birdies,
Let them on their rushing pinions
Soar aloft amid the heavens.

˝If it be a shoal of salmon,
Or a shoal of other fishes,
Let them leap as they are swimming,
Plunging then beneath the water.
˝If it be a rocky island,
Or a stump amid the water,
Let the billows rise above it,
Or the waters drive it forward.˝
Now the boat came gliding onward,
And the new boat sailed on swiftly

Forward to the misty headland,
And the shady island´s ending.
Annikki, the ever-famous,
Saw the vessel fast approaching,
Saw the hundred-boarded passing,
And she spoke the words which follow:
˝If thou art my brotherˊs vessels
Or the vessel of my father,
Then direct thy journey homeward,
To the shore the prow directing,

Where the landing-stage is stationed,
While the stern is pointing from it.
If thou art a stranger vessel,
Mayˊst thou swim at greater distance,
Towards another stage then hasten,
With the stern to this directed.˝
´Twas no vessel of her household,
Nor a boat from foreign regions,
But the boat of Väinämöinen,
Built by him, the bard primeval,

And the boat approached quite closely,
Onward sailed in hailing distance,
Till a word, and then a second,
And a third were heard distinctly.
Annikki, the ever-famous,
Night´s fair daughter, maid of twilight,
Hailed the boat as it approached her:
˝Whither goest thou, Väinämöinen,
Whither, hero of the waters,
Wherefore, pride of all the country?˝

Then the aged Väinämöinen
From the boat made ready answer:
˝I am going salmon-fishing,
Where the salmon-trout are spawning,
In the gloomy stream of Tuoni,
In the deep reed-bordered river.˝
Annikki, the ever-famous,
Answered in the words which follow:
˝Tell me not such idle falsehoods!
Well I know the spawning season,

For aforetime oft my father
And my grandsire; too, before him,
Often went a salmon-fishing,
And the salmon-trout to capture.
In the boats the nets were lying,
And the boats were full of tackle,
Here lay nets, here lines were resting,
And the beating-poles beside them;
And beneath the seats were tridents,
In the stern, long staves were lying.

Whither goest thou, Väinämöinen,
Wherefore, O Uvantolainen?˝
Said the aged Väinämöinen,
˝Forth in search of geese I wander,
Where the bright-winged birds are sporting,
And the slimy fish are catching,
In the deep sound of the Saxons,
Where the sea is wide and open.˝
Annikki, the ever-famous,
Answered in the words which follow:

˝Well I know who speaks me truly,
And can soon detect the liar,
For aforetime oft my father,
And my grandsire, too, before him,
Went abroad the geese to capture,
And to chase the red-beaked quarry,
And his bow was great, and tight-strung,
And the bow he drew was splendid,
And a black dog leashed securely,
In the stern was tightly tethered,

On the strand the hounds were running,
And the whelps across the shingle;
Speak the truth, O Väinämöinen,
Whither do you take your journey?˝
Said the aged Väinämöinen,
˝Wherefore take I not my journey,
Where a mighty fight is raging,
There to fight among my equals,
Where the greaves with blood are spattered,
Even to the knees all crimsoned?˝

Annikki again insisted,
Loudly cried the tin-adorned one:
˝Well I know the ways of battle,
For aforetime went my father
Where a mighty fight was raging,
There to fight among his equals,
And a hundred men were rowing,
And a thousand men were standing.
In the prow their bows were lying,
And beneath the seats their sword-blades.

Speak the truth, and tell me truly,
Cease to lie, and speak sincerely.
Whither goest thou, Väinämöinen,
Wherefore, O Suvantolainen?˝
Then the aged Väinämöinen
Answered in the words which follow:
˝Come thou in my boat, O maiden,
In my boat, O maiden seat thee,
And the truth I then will tell thee,
Cease to lie, and speak sincerely.˝

Annikki, the tin-adorned one,
Cried aloud in indignation:
˝May the wind assail thy vessel,
And the east wind fall upon it,
May thy boat capsize beneath thee,
And the prow sink down beneath thee,
If you will not tell me truly
Where you mean to take your journey,
If the truth you will not tell me,
And at last will end your lying.˝

Then the aged Väinämöinen,
Answered in the words which follow:
˝All the truth I now will tell you,
Though at first I lied a little.
Forth I fare to woo a maiden,
Seek the favour of a maiden,
In the gloomy land of Pohja,
Sariola, for ever misty,
In the land where men are eaten,
Where they even drown the heroes.˝

Annikki, the ever-famous,
Night´s fair daughter, maid of twilight,
When she knew the truth for certain,
All the truth, without evasion,
Down she threw her caps unwashen,
And unrinsed she left the clothing,
On the bench she left them lying,
Where the red bridge has its ending,
In her hand her gown she gathered,
In her hand the folds collecting,

And began from thence to hasten,
And with rapid pace she hurried,
Till at length she reached the smithy.
To the forge at once she hastened.
There she found smith Ilmarinen,
He the great primeval craftsman.
And he forged a bench of iron,
And adorned it all with silver.
Cubit-high his head was sooted,
On his shoulders ash by fathoms.

Annikki the door then entered,
And she spoke the words which follow:
˝Smith and brother Ilmarinen,
Thou the great primeval craftsman,
Forge me now a weavers shuttle,
Pretty rings to deck my fingers,
Golden earrings, two or three pairs,
Five or six linked girdles make me,
For most weighty truth Iˊll tell you,
All the truth without evasion.˝

Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,
˝If you tell me news important,
Then a shuttle will I forge you,
Pretty rings to deck your fingers,
And a cross upon your bosom,
And the finest head-dress forge you.
If the words you speak are evil,
All your ornaments Iˊll shatter,
Tear them off to feed the furnace,
And beneath the forge will thrust them.˝

Annikki, the ever-famous,
Answered in the words which follow:
˝O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,
Do you still propose to marry
Her, the bride who once was promised,
And as wife was pledged unto you?
˝While you weld and hammer always,
Ever working with your hammer,
Making horseshoes in the summer,
Iron horseshoes for the winter,

Working at your sledge at night-time,
And its frame in daytime shaping,
Forth to journey to your wooing,
And to Pohjola to travel,
One more cunning goes before you,
And another speeds beyond you,
And your own will capture from you,
And your love will ravish from you,
Whom two years ago thou sawest,
Whom two years agone thou wooed´st.

Know that Väinämöinen journeys
O´er the blue waves of the ocean,
In a boat with prow all golden,
Steering with his copper rudder,
To the gloomy land of Pohja,
Sariola, for ever misty.˝
To the smith came grievous trouble.
To the iron-worker sorrow.
From his grasp the tongs slid downward,
From his hand he dropped the hammer.

Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,
˝Annikki, my little sister,
I will forge you now a shuttle.
Pretty rings to deck your fingers,
Golden earrings, two or three pairs,
Five or six linked girdles make you.
Warm for me the pleasant bathroom,
Fill the room with fragrant vapour,
Let the logs you burn be small ones,
And the fire with chips be kindled,

And prepare me too some ashes,
And some soap in haste provide me,
That I wash my head and cleanse it,
And I may make white my body
From the coal-dust of the autumn,
From the forge throughout the winter.˝
Annikki, whose name was famous,
Heated secretly the bathroom,
With the boughs the wind had broken,
And the thunderbolt had shattered.

Stones she gathered from the river,
Heated them till they were ready,
Cheerfully she fetched the water,
From the holy well she brought it,
Broke some bath-whisks from the bushes,
Charming bath-whisks from the thickets,
And she warmed the honeyed bath-whisks,
On the honeyed stones she warmed them,
Then with milk she mixed the ashes,
And she made him soap of marrow,

And she worked the soap to lather,
Kneaded then the soap to lather,
That his head might cleanse the bridegroom,
And might cleanse himself completely.
Then the smith, eˊen Ilmarinen,
He the great primeval craftsman,
Wrought the maiden what she wished for,
And he wrought a splendid head-dress,
While she made the bathroom ready,
And she put the bath in order.310
In her hands he placed the trinkets,
And the maiden thus addressed him:
˝Now the bathroom´s filled with vapour,
And the vapour-bath I´ve heated,
And have steeped the bath-whisks nicely,
Choosing out the best among them.
Bathe, O brother, at your pleasures,
Pouring water as you need it,
Wash your head to flaxen colour,
Till your eyes shine out like snowflakes.˝

Then the smith, eˊen Ilmarinen,
Went to take the bath he needed,
There he bathed himself at pleasure,
And he washed himself to whiteness,
Washed his eyes until they sparkled,
And his temples till they glistened,
And his neck to henˊs-egg whiteness,
And his body all was shining.
From the bath the room he entered,
Changed so much they scarcely knew him,

For his face it shone with beauty,
And his cheeks were cleansed and rosy.
Then he spoke the words which follow:
˝Annikki, my little sister,
Bring me now a shirt of linen,
And the best of raiment bring me,
That I robe myself completely,
And may deck me like a bridegroom.˝
Annikki, the ever-famous,
Brought him then a shirt of linen,

For his limbs no longer sweating,
For his body all uncovered.
Then she brought well-fitting trousers,
Which his mother had been sewing,
For his hips, no longer sooty,
And his legs were fully covered.
Then she brought him finest stockings,
Which, as maid, had wove his mother,
And with these his shins he covered,
And his calves were hidden by them.

Then she brought him shoes that fitted,
Best of Saxon boots she brought him,
And with these the stockings covered
Which his mother sewed as maiden;
Then a coat of blue she chose him,
With a liver-coloured lining,
Covering thus the shirt of linen,
Which of finest flax was fashioned,
Then an overcoat of woollen,
Of four kinds of cloth constructed,

Oˊer the coat of bluish colour,
Of the very latest fashion,
And a new fur, thousand-buttoned,
And a hundredfold more splendid,
Oˊer the overcoat of woollen,
And the cloth completely hiding;
Round his waist a belt she fastened,
And the belt was gold-embroidered,
Which his mother wrought as maiden,
Wrought it when a fair-haired maiden,

Brightly-coloured gloves she brought him,
Gold-embroidered, for his fingers,
Which the Lapland children fashioned;
On his handsome hands he drew them,
Then a high-crowned hat she brought him
(On his golden locks she placed it)
Which his father once had purchased,
When as bridegroom he adorned him.
Thus the smith, eˊen Ilmarinen,
Clothed himself, and made him ready,

Robed himself, and made him handsome,
And his servant he commanded:
˝Yoke me now a rapid courser,
In the sledge adorned so finely,
That I start upon my journey,
And to Pohjola may travel.˝
Thereupon the servant answered,
˝Horses six are in the stable,
Horses six, on oats that fatten;
Which among them shall I yoke you?˝

Said the smith, eˊen Ilmarinen,
˝Take the best of all the stallions,
Put the foal into the harness,
Yoke before the sledge the chestnut,
Then provide me with six cuckoos,
Seven blue birds at once provide me,
That upon the frame they perch them,
And may sing their cheerful music,
That the fair ones may behold them,
And the maidens be delighted.

Then provide me with a bearskin,
That I seat myself upon it,
And a second hide of walrus,
That the bright-hued sledge is covered.˝
Thereupon the skilful servant,
He the servant paid with wages,
Put the colt into the harness,
Yoked before the sledge the chestnut,
And provided six fine cuckoos,
Seven blue birds at once provided,

That upon the frame should perch them,
And should sing their cheerful music;
And a bearskin next provided,
That his lord should sit upon it,
And another hide of walrus,
And with this the sledge he covered.
Then the smith, eˊen Ilmarinen,
He the great primeval craftsman,
Sent aloft his prayer to Ukko,
And he thus besought the Thunderer:

˝Scatter forth thy snow, O Ukko,
Let the snowflakes soft be drifted,
That the sledge may glide oˊer snowfields,
Oˊer the snow-drifts gliding swiftly.˝
Then the snow did Ukko scatter,
And the snowflakes soft were drifted,
Till the heath-stems all were covered,
On the ground the berry-bushes.
Then the smith, eˊen Ilmarinen,
In his sledge of iron sat him,

And he spoke the words which follow,
And in words like these expressed him:
˝On my reins attend good fortune,
Jumala my sledge protecting,
That my reins good fortune fail not,
Nor my sledge may break, O Jumala!˝
In one hand the reins he gathered,
And the whip he grasped with other,
Oˊer the horse the whip he brandished,
And he spoke the words which follow:

˝Whitebrow, speed thou quickly onward,
Haste away, O flaxen-maned one.˝
On the way the horse sprang forward,
On the waterˊs sandy margin,
By the shores of Sound of Sima,
Past the hills with alders covered.
On the shore the sledge went rattling,
On the beach the shingle clattered.
In his eyes the sand was flying,
To his breast splashed up the water.

Thus he drove one day, a second,
Drove upon the third day likewise,
And at length upon the third day,
Overtook old Väinämöinen,
And he spoke the words which follow,
And in words like these expressed him:
˝O thou aged Väinämöinen,
Let us make a friendly compact,
That although we both are seeking,
And we both would woo the maiden,

Yet by force we will not seize her,
Nor against her will shall wed her.˝
Said the aged Väinämöinen,
˝I will make a friendly compact,
That we will not seize the maiden,
Nor against her will shall wed her.
Let the maiden now be given
To the husband whom she chooses,
That we nurse not long vexation,
Nor a lasting feud be fostered.˝

Further on their way they travelled,
On the path that each had chosen;
Sped the boat, the shore re-echoed,
Ran the horse, the earth resounded.
But a short time passed thereafter,
Very short the time elapsing,
Ere the grey-brown dog was barking,
And the house-dog loudly baying,
In the gloomy land of Pohja,
Sariola, for ever cloudy,

Sooner still the dog was growling,
But with less-continued growling,
By the borders of the cornfield,
ˊGainst the ground his tail was wagging.
Then exclaimed the Lord of Pohja,
˝Go, my daughter, to discover
Why the grey-brown dog is barking,
And the long-eared dog is baying.˝
But the daughter made him answer:
˝I have not the time, my father,

I must clean the largest cowshed,
Tend our herd of many cattle,
Grind the corn between the millstones,
Through the sieve must sift the flour,
Grind the corn to finest flour,
And the grinder is but feeble.˝
Gently barked the castleˊs Hiisi,
And again the dog was growling,
And again said Pohjaˊs Master:
˝Go, old dame, and look about you,

See why barks the grey-brown house-dog,
Why the castle-dog is growling.˝
But the old dame made him answer:
˝This is not a time for talking,
For my household cares are heavy,
And I must prepare the dinner,
And must bake a loaf enormous,
And for this the dough be kneading,
Bake the loaf of finest flour,
And the baker is but feeble.˝

Thereupon said Pohjaˊs Master:
˝Women they are always hurried,
And the maidens always busy,
When before the stove they roast them,
When they in their beds are lying;
Son, go you, and look around you.˝
Thereupon the son made answer:
˝Iˊve no time to look about me;
I must grind the blunted hatchet,
Chop a log of wood to pieces,

Chop to bits the largest wood-pile,
And to faggots small reduce it.
Large the pile, and small the faggots,
And the workman of the weakest.˝
Still the castle-dog was barking,
And the yard-dog still was barking,
And the furious whelp was baying,
And the island watch-dog howling,
Sitting by the furthest cornfield,
And his tail was briskly wagging.

Then again said Pohjaˊs Master,
˝Not for nought the dog is barking,
Never has he barked for nothing,
Never growls he at the fir-trees.˝
So he went to reconnoitre,
And he walked across the courtyard,
To the cornfieldˊs furthest borders,
To the path beyond the ploughed land.
Gazed he where the dogˊs snout pointed,
Where he saw his muzzle pointing,

To the hill where storms are raging,
To the hills where grow the alders,
Then he saw the truth most clearly,
Why the grey-brown dog was barking,
And the pride of earth was baying,
And the woolly-tailed one howling,
For he saw a red boat sailing
Out amid the Bay of Lempi,
And a handsome sledge was driving
On the shore of Sound of Sima.

After this the Lord of Pohja
To the house returned directly,
And beneath the roof he hastened,
And he spoke the words which follow:
˝There are strangers swiftly sailing
Oˊer the blue lakeˊs watery surface,
And a gaudy sledge is gliding
On the shore of Sound of Sima;
And a large boat is approaching
To the shore of Bay of Lempi.˝

Then said Pohjolaˊs old Mistress,
˝Whence shall we obtain an omen
Why these strangers here are coming?
O my little waiting-maiden,
On the fire lay rowan-faggots.
And the best log in its glowing.
If the log with blood is flowing,
Then the strangers come for battle,
If the log exudes clear water,
Then is peace abiding with us.˝

Then the little maid of Pohja,
She, the modest waiting-maiden,
On the fire laid rowan-faggots,
Placed the best log in its glowing.
From the log no blood was trickling,
Nor did water trickle from it;
From the log there oozed forth honey,
From the log dripped down the nectar.
From the corner spoke Suovakko,
Spoke the old dame ˊneath the blankets:

˝From the log if oozes honey,
From the log if drips the nectar,
Then the strangers who are coming,
May be ranked as noble suitors.˝
Then did Pohjaˊs aged Mistress,
Pohjaˊs old dame, Pohjaˊs daughter,

To the courtyard fencing hasten,
Hurry quick across the courtyard,
And they gazed across the water,
To the south their heads then turning,

And they saw from thence approaching,
Swift a ship of novel fashion,
Of a hundred planks constructed,
Out upon the Bay of Lempi.
Underneath the boat looked bluish,
But the sails of crimson colour.
In the stern there sat a hero,
At the copper rudderˊs handle,
And they saw a stallion trotting
With a red sledge strange of aspect,

And the gaudy sledge was speeding
On the shore of Sound of Sima,
And they saw six golden cuckoos,
Perching on the frame, and calling,
Seven blue birds were likewise perching
On the reins, and these were singing;
And a stalwart hero, sitting
In the sledge, the reins was holding.
Then said Pohjolaˊs old Mistress,
And she spoke the words which follow:

˝Whom will you accept as husband,
If they really come to woo you,
As a life-companion woo you,
Dove-like in his arms to nestle?
˝He who in the boat is sailing,
In the red boat fast approaching,
Out upon the Bay of Lempi,
Is the aged Väinämöinen.
In the boat he brings provisions,
And of treasures brings a cargo.

˝He who in the sledge is driving,
In the gaudy sledge is speeding,
On the shore of Sound of Sima,
Is the smith named Ilmarinen.
He with empty hands is coming;
Filled his sledge with spells of magic.
˝Therefore if the room they enter,
Bring them then the mead in tankard,
In the two-eared tankard bring it,
And in his hands place the tankard

Whom thou dost desire to follow;
Choose thou Väinöläˊs great hero,
He whose boat with wealth is loaded,
And of treasures brings a cargo.˝
But the lovely maid of Pohja,
Thus made answer to her mother:
˝O my mother who hast borne me,
O my mother who hast reared me,
Nothing do I care for riches,
Nor a man profound in wisdom,

But a man of lofty forehead,
One whose every limb is handsome.
Never once in former ages,
Gave a maid her life in thiswise.
I, a maid undowered, will follow
Ilmarinen, skilful craftsman,
He it was who forged the Sampo,
And the coloured cover welded.˝
Then said Pohjaˊs aged Mistress,
˝O indeed, my child, my lambkin,

If you go with Ilmarinen,
From whose brow the sweat falls freely,
You must wash the blacksmithˊs aprons,
And the blacksmithˊs head wash likewise.˝
But the daughter gave her answer,
In the very words which follow:
˝Him from Väinölä I choose not,
Nor an aged man will care for,
For an old man is a nuisance,
And an aged man would vex me.˝

Then did aged Väinämöinen
Reach his journeyˊs end the soonest,
And he steered his crimson vessel,
Brought his boat of bluish colour
To the rollers steel-constructed,
To the landing-stage of copper.
After this the house he entered,
Underneath the roof he hastened,
And upon the floor spoke loudly,
Near the door beneath the rafters,

And he spoke the words which follow,
And expressed himself in thiswise:
˝Wilt thou come with me, O maiden,
Evermore as my companion,
Wife-like on my knees to seat thee,
In my arms as dove to nestle?˝
Then the lovely maid of Pohja,
Answered in the words which follow:
˝Have you then the boat constructed,
Built the large and handsome vessel,

From the splinters of my spindle,
From the fragments of my shuttle?˝
Then the aged Väinämöinen
Answered in the words which follow:
˝I have built a noble vessel
And a splendid boat constructed,
Strongly built to face the tempests,
And the winds its course opposing,
As It cleaves the tossing billows,
Oˊer the surface of the water,

Bladder-like amid the surges,
As a leaf, by current drifted,
Over Pohjolaˊs wide waters,
And across the foaming billows.˝
Then the lovely maid of Pohja,
Answered in the words which follow:
˝Nothing do I reck of seamen,
Heroes boasting of the billows!
Drives the wind their minds to ocean,
And their thoughts the east wind saddens:

Therefore thee I cannot follow,
Never pledge myself unto thee,
Evermore as thy companion,
In thy arms as dove to nestle,
Spread the couch whereon thou sleepest,
For thy head arrange the pillows.˝
