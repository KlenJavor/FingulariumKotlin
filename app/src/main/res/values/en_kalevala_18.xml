Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,
Pondered deeply and reflected
How he best should woo the maiden,
Hasten to the long-haired maiden,
In the gloomy land of Pohja,
Sariola, for ever misty,
She the far-famed Maid of Pohja,
She the peerless Bride of Pohja.
There the pale-grey boat was lying,
And the boat with red he painted,

And adorned the prow with gilding,
And with silver overlaid it;
Then upon the morning after,
Very early in the morning,
Pushed his boat into the water,
In the waves the hundred-boarded,
Pushed it from the barkless rollers,
From the rounded logs of pine-tree.
Then he raised a mast upon it,
On the masts the sails he hoisted,

Raised a red sail on the vessel,
And another blue in colour,
Then the boat himself he boarded,
And he walked upon the planking,
And upon the sea he steered it,
Oˊer the blue and plashing billows.
Then he spoke the words which follow,
And in words like these expressed him:
˝Enter, Jumala, my vessel,
Enter here, O thorn most gracious,

Strengthen thou the hero´s weakness,
And the weakling do thou cherish,
On these far-extending waters,
On the wide expanse of billows.

˝Breathe, O wind, upon the vessel,
Drive, O wave, the boat before thee,
That I need not row with fingers,
Nor may thus disturb the waters,
On the wide expanse of ocean,
Out upon the open ocean.˝
